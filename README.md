# House Price Prediction Using a XGBoost Classifier
Built a Linear Regression and XGBoost model to predict house prices from the Boston houses prices dataset
XGBoost is a decision-tree-based ensemble Machine Learning algorithm that uses a gradient boosting framework.
In this project, we tried to predict house price in Boston using the Sklearn boston house prices dataset, we started of first by pre processing the data available then went into analysing it, we then performed a Train Test split where we used the train_test_split from the sklearn.model_selection library.
After that, we used a XGBoost Regressor Classifier in order to classify the trained data and performed an evaluation test using both a R squared error and Mean Absolute Error evaluation provided by the metrics library from sklearn.
We performed the same operation with the test data and retrieved the ending results from the model.
